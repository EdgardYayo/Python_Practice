# # Describe Problem
# def my_function():
#   The problem is the for loop is looping only from 1 to 19 because 20 is non inclusive
#   for i in range(1, 20):
#     if i == 20:
#       print("You got it")
# my_function()

# # Reproduce the Bug
# from random import randint
# dice_imgs = ["❶", "❷", "❸", "❹", "❺", "❻"]
# The problem is when randint function choose randomly 6 the list is out of range
# dice_num = randint(1, 6)
# print(dice_imgs[dice_num])

# # Play Computer
# year = int(input("What's your year of birth?"))
# if year > 1980 and year < 1994:
#   print("You are a millenial.")
# elif year >= 1994:
#   print("You are a Gen Z.")

# # Fix the Errors
# The print inside the the if statement needs indentation
# The input is a str need to be integer to do comparison
# And the last print need to be an f string in order to print the value of the variable age
# age = input("How old are you?")
# if age > 18:
# print("You can drive at age {age}.")

# #Print is Your Friend
# pages = 0
# word_per_page = 0
# pages = int(input("Number of pages: "))
# word_per_page == int(input("Number of words per page: "))
# total_words = pages * word_per_page
# print(total_words)

# #Use a Debugger
# def mutate(a_list):
#   b_list = []
#   for item in a_list:
#     new_item = item * 2
#   b_list.append(new_item)
#   print(b_list)

# mutate([1,2,3,5,8,13])
